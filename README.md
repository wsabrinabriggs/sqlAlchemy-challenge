# sqlAlchemy-challenge

Hello and thank you for reading.

This challenge was not fun and only reinforced what I already know: that I'm not yet understanding how to query using objects and the vocabulary associated with querying and ORM.

In addition to tutoring, here is a list of coding Help I used
1. converting object into a Pandas df - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75309237/read-sql-query-throws-optionengine-object-has-no-attribute-execute-with
2. SQLite Order By - https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/sqlite-order-by/
3. determining order of conditional clauses - [WHERE Date >=2010-01-01 ](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sqlite/sqlite_order_by.htm)https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sqlite/sqlite_order_by.htm and https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/sqlite-order-by/
4. how to sort the dataframe by column - https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.sort_values.html
5. sqlalchemy documentation for station analysis section - https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/14/orm/tutorial.html#counting, https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/14/orm/tutorial.html#common-filter-operators
6. histogram making support - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SL89I9VS44
7. The code for the both graphs and most of the station analysis section were code from multiple tutors
